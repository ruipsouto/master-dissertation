Intending to address current query optimization limitations of relational databases, this document describes the design and implementation of a proof-of-concept to provide machine learning capabilities to conventional database systems. At a high level, Odin implements predictive modeling techniques to guide a traditional query optimizer and select the execution strategy the query optimizer should use for that query, limiting and steering the search space. To achieve this, the approach relies on the availability of historical query execution data to generate predictive models and estimate the cost of executing alternative plans, each generated under different optimizer configurations.

The proposed solution improves the system's decision-making process, making it more dynamic and adaptive instead of relying entirely on a complex set of heuristics and statistical estimates. In addition, it does not replace or discard the query optimizer completely but instead adopts procedures readily available in most relational database systems and works in tandem with the query optimizer to improve query runtime. Finally, it provides a flexible, embedded, and extensible architecture supporting new data sources and query processing and optimization approaches.
